# This is the xinitrc startup script for xmonad

# Ideally, general xinitrc stuff would go in ~/.xinitrc. But I want to make
# sure that everything is under source control, so I'm going to put the general
# stuff in here instead. If we have more than 1 window manager we use (which is
# unlikely), then we'll just have to duplicate it.

# background image
# This doesn't seem to work for wmii if called before wmii is run
#  Probably b/c wmii is "overwriting" the background on its own
# Does work for xmonad however, and we're moving towards that anyways
